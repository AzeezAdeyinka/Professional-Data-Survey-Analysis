### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing survey responses from data professionals around the world. 
The goal was to explore salary trends, demographic insights, challenges in entering the industry, and popular tools/programming languages.
The insights were visualized using an interactive dashboard built in Power BI to help stakeholders better understand the current landscape of the data industry.

### Data Source
Kaggle

### Tools
- Power BI and Dax

### Data Cleaning
- Removed missing or irrelevant data points (e.g., incomplete responses)

- Standardized job role and country names for consistency

- Converted text-based responses into numerical values for analysis (e.g., salary, satisfaction scores)

- Filtered outliers to ensure realistic visual representation of salaries

### Data Analysis
Key insights derived from the dashboard include:

- Average Salary by Job Role: Data Scientists earn the most ($88k), followed by Data Architects and Engineers.

- Country by Salary: United States leads with an average of $77.69k, while India has the lowest average at $29.91k.

- Salary Satisfaction: The average satisfaction score is 4.27 out of 10, indicating room for improvement.

- Favorite Programming Language: Python dominates, followed by R, C/C++, and a few others.

- Break-in Challenges: Most respondents found it moderately difficult to enter the data industry.

- Gender Distribution by Salary: Visual comparison of salary across gender.

### Results 
- Clear salary disparities exist across roles and countries.

- Python remains the dominant language in the data field.

- A majority of respondents face some level of difficulty breaking into the data industry.

- There is moderate satisfaction with current salaries across the field.
